##Basis
We have been tasked to finish building a simple web-based RPG that lets a human player fight against an array of different enemies. We will be using a series of new elements we have learned but focusing heavily on Jquery and Prototypal Inheritance.

## User Instructions

1. Begin by typing in the name of your adventure (pony name). Click on the 'Select Class' button to proceed.
1. It is now time to choose your path. May the force be with you. Once you have clicked on one of the many options, click on the 'Select Weapon' button to proceed.
1. It is now time to choose your weapon. Click on the item of your choosing. Each one will contain different damage levels. Choose wisely. Once selected, click on the "Defeat Your Enemies" button.
1. The battlefield will populate. It is up to you to defeat the deadly Orc's. Will you rise or will you fall?
1. Click on the "Attack" button to perform your melee. Once the winner or loser has been decided- A message to play again will appear. Do you dare?


## NSS Requirements

Once the player has chosen all options for class, weapon, etc., you need to have a battlefield view that fulfills the following criteria:

1. Display the initial statistics for the player and the enemy.
1. Have a button with the label "Attack".
1. Each time the attack button is clicked, the player's chosen character and the generated enemy should attack with their weapon, and once the damage is calculated, subtract that from the opponents' health.
1. As soon as either combatant reaches health of 0, disable the attack button and annouce the winner.
